# Media processing

This section will walk you through the process from uploading your source file to playing it back in a player.

Here are the key steps you'll need to follow:

1. Import your source file (mp4, mkv, ...)
2. Start a transcode API call with your configuration (such as quality levels, bitrates, audio tracks, ...)
3. Start a package API call to generate an HLS playlist.

Check the [API reference](/reference/api) for the available options for transcoding, packaging and more.
